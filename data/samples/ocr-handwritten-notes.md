UX Design Fundamentals - Class 3

User Research Methods:
- Interviews: 1-on-1 conversations, open-ended questions
  * Best for: understanding motivations and pain points
  * Sample size: 5-8 users is usually enough for patterns

- Surveys: quantitative data, large sample
  * Best for: validating hypotheses with numbers
  * Use Likert scales for measuring satisfaction

- Usability Testing: observe users completing tasks
  * Think-aloud protocol: ask users to verbalize thoughts
  * Measure: task completion rate, time on task, errors

Key takeaway: always triangulate methods
(use at least 2 different methods to validate findings)

Nielsen's Heuristics (top 5):
1. Visibility of system status
2. Match between system and real world
3. User control and freedom
4. Consistency and standards
5. Error prevention
